 * Neo Smart Controller
 *
 * Calls URIs with HTTP GET for shade open/close/stop/favourite using the Neo Smart Controller
 * 
 * Assumption: The blinds (or room of blinds) you're controlling all take the 
 * same amount of time to open/close (some may be a little faster/slower than
 * the others, but they should all generally take the same amount of time to
 * otherwise, create another virtual driver for ones that are slower/faster). 
 * 
 * To use: 
 * 1) Run a stopwatch to time how long it takes for the blinds to close (in
 * seconds)
 * 2) Open the blinds completely then time how long it takes to get to your
 * favorite setting) 
 * 
 * Input these values in the configuration, rounding down.  Your device will
 * like a dimmable bulb to Alexa, thus you should be able to say "Alexa, turn
 * the living room blinds to 50%" and it will go in the middle (or close). 
 *
 * Keep in mind, in order for this to work you have to always control the
 * blinds through Hubitat and not the Neo App or RF remote. 
 *  
 * Based on the Hubitat community driver httpGetSwitch and initial
 * contributions and testing from bigrizz and others via Hubitat community:
 * https://community.hubitat.com/t/neo-smart-controller-for-blinds/.

 * 
 * Version   1: bigrizz - initial commits
 *         1.1: bdwilson - parameterized inputs & preliminary level settings, fixed time stamp
 *         1.2: bdwilson - adjusted level settings to use runIn vs. blocking delays
 *         1.3: bdwilson - setup timing-based movement tracking to estimate 
 *              where the blinds are so that open/close/stop and level-based
 *              locations somewhat work. This still has the assumptions from
 *              above. If your "50%" or "25" locations aren't in the right
 *              place, adjust your timing up or down to tweak
 *              - Config option to stop if you press open or close for a second
 *              time (since I'm using a 2 button controller for open/close/stop)
 *       1.3.1: moved to open vs. opened. keep version in states.
 *       1.3.2: added config to stop if you change directions vs. changing
 * 				direction.
 * 		 1.3.3  added position and targetPosition attributes so homebridge will 
 *              stop complaining. fixes errors, but no idea if they are
 *              implemented correctÅ€y.. 16JUN24.
